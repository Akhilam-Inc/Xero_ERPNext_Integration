# Overview

The Xero ERPNext Integration app brings together accounting workflows managed in Xero with operational processes handled in ERPNext. It focuses on secure data synchronisation, predictable scheduling, and configurable mappings so that finance and operations teams always work on a consistent dataset.

The integration is opinionated enough to work out of the box, while still allowing you to tailor synchronisation windows, mapping rules, and automation behaviour to match your organisation’s practices.
